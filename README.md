# Event-Entry-Time-Display
This project is a web application that uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user interface for displaying and modifying a current timeslot. The application is powered by a Python-based web server that serves the HTML and JavaScript files, and provides an API for updating the timeslot value stored in an Excel file.
